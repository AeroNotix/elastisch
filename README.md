# Elastisch, a Clojure client for Elastic Search

Elastisch is a Clojure client for Elastic Search, a modern distributed RESTful search engine.

[![Continuous Integration status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/clojurewerkz/elastisch.png)](http://travis-ci.org/clojurewerkz/elastisch)

## Project Goals

 * Closely follow recent Elastic Search releases & features.
 * Be well documented.
 * Be well tested.
 * Be maintained.
 * Integrate with libraries like clojure.data.json and Joda Time.
 * Learn from other clients like the Java and Ruby ones.
 * Target Clojure 1.3.0 and later from the ground up.


### Why not wrap Java API?

Wrapping ES Java client may produce a performance gain but we don't see that to be very useful, and
following Java client conventions would likely make Elastish less Clojurish.


## Documentation & Examples

We are working on documentation guides & examples site for the 1.0 release. In the meantime, please refer to the [test suite](https://github.com/michaelklishin/elastisch/tree/master/test/elastisch/test) for code examples.


## This is a Work In Progress

Core Elastisch APIs are stabilized but it is still a work in progress. Keep that in mind. 1.0 will be released in early 2012
together with documentation guides and dedicated website.


## Artifacts

Snapshot artifacts are [released to Clojars](https://clojars.org/clojurewerkz/elastisch) every few days.

With Leiningen:

    [clojurewerkz/elastisch "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"]


With Maven:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>clojurewerkz</groupId>
      <artifactId>elastisch</artifactId>
      <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>


## Supported Clojure versions

Elastisch is built from the ground up for Clojure 1.3 and up.


## Quickstart

## Creating an index with mapping

```clojure
(let [mapping { :person {
                  :properties {
                  :first-name { :type "string" :store "yes" }
                  :last-name  { :type "string" }
                  :title      { :type "string" :analyzer "snowball" }
                  :biography  { :type "string" :analyzer "snowball"}}}}]
  (elastisch.index/create "people" :mappings mapping))
```

## Storing documents in index
```clojure
(let [document {:first-name "Jack"
              :last-name  "Black"
              :title      "Sales Manager"
              :biography  "Tries to avoid eating fat, being good to other people and does sports every now and then" }]
  ;; with autogenerated id
  (elastisch.document/create "people" "person" document)

  ;; manually set id
  (elastisch.document/put "people" "person" 152 document))
```

## Querying index
```clojure
  (elastisch.document/search :query (elastisch.query/term :foo "bar"))
```


## Pitfalls

Right now clj-http's default behavior (to throw exceptions for 40x and 50x responses) is off. Most likely, that will become configurable,
throwing exceptions by default, since REST client should behave as close to binary driver as possible and
mimic server behavior where possible.
